# Introduction

Each folder illustrates a simple trick to use with Python. In general they are intended
for scripting purposes but some of them can be reused for general purpose code.


# Each trick

Each folder has its own README and requirements (if needed) so they should be independent
from each other. They are together for educational purposes.
