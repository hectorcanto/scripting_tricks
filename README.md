# Introduction
Each folder ilustrates a simple trick to use with Python. In general they are intended
for scripting purposes but some of them can be reused in general purpose code.

# License

I've not decided the specific license yet but feel free to use as you please:
- copy, modify, fork ... whatever
I will really like any feedback or suggestion.

# Each trick
Each folder has is own README and requirements (if needed) so they should be independent
from each other. They are together for educational purposes.
